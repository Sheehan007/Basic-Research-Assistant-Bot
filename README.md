# Basic-Research-Assistant-Bot
Created a Research Assistant using Python from the knowledge that I learned from multiple resources including books and tutorials. 
It was a fun little experiment that I carried out during my summer break. I was reading a few research papers on Quantum Computing and was exhausted after reading... 3 pages. 
Thought I should try automating the process (I don't recommended this though)!  

How it works:
1. Add a research paper in PDF format in the code itself.
2. It will take a little while to process (depends on the hardware ig..)
3. It will breakdown the research paper based on the number of chunks (you may tweak with that as well)
4. It will prompt you to ask questions that you may have based on the research paper and the summary that has been provided by the assistant
5. et Voila! You've got the paper summary in less than a minute...

P.S: Still suggested that you go through the paper thoroughly tho!! Cheers!
